      "text": "Gimme5 was a social media app project for Codingschule.de. I built it together with my colleague Kathrin as a full-stack, single-page web application. The idea was to build a platform where you can share your five favourite things with the world. The app has a login and registration system, a feed where you can see all the posts of the users you follow, a profile page where you can see all your own posts and edit your profile, and a like and comment system.",
